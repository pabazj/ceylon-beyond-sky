            After breakfast starts the hiking and trekking in Ella. Start your hike to the peak of
            the Ella rock. Ella rock is a huge rocky peak that looms over Ella town. It is a
            moderate-level tropical hike. The views from the top of Ella rock on a clear day
            are nothing less than rewarding. The rock cliff has no safety railings and has
            become a favorite spot for daredevil photography. The hike itself is an interesting
            mix of railway tracks, tea plantations, steep climbs, and shady walks. After the Ella
            rock hike, you will be taken to visit the famous Nine Arch Bridge. This beautiful
            colonial railway bridge is made of brick, which is a really nice place for photo
            lovers. When one stands underneath it and looks up there is a beautiful sight of
            ‘nine skies’ through the nine arches, hence it’s called as Nine Skies Bridge. It is
            also called ‘The Bridge in the sky due to its sheer height.You will enjoy your
            packed lunch in a beautiful location Start your next hike to Little Adam’s Peak.
            Little Adam’s peak is a pyramid-shaped rock located opposite the relatively huge
            Ella rock. Nonetheless, it offers amazing views of the Ella rock, Rawana Falls, and
            surrounding valleys. Best reached in the early mornings, the little Adam’s peak is
            often covered in mist. It is an easy hike with the path zig-zagging around the back
            of little Adam’s peak hill and only a bit steep near the top.
