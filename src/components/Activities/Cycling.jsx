            This is the most adventurous and satisfying package of cycling trips in Sri Lanka for Bravehearts. The
            center of the island refers to Central Highlands for a valid reason. These are the real expeditions that
            take you to mysterious mountains, hilltops, challenging inclined trekking trails, waterfalls, and the
            highest points on the island that almost gives you a birds-eye view of the surroundings (jaw-dropping
            views.) Kandy, Nuwara Eliya, Ella, Horton Plains, Hanthana, Little Adam’s Peak, Knuckles, Pidurangala,
            and Hatton are the best sites for adventuresome mountain bike tours in Sri Lanka.
